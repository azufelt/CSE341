Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
  https://github.com/azufelt/cse341

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
  ·Express and EJS were used
  ·Middleware functions are routing correctly
  ·Express used to serve static Public folder holds and displays client-side CSS
  ·POST method is working, displaying key:value pair to console
  ·User can input information

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
  ·Unsure if the '/' and '/user' are supposed to connect to the shop/add-product pages... It was partof the assignment to make a new directory for the '/' and '/user' so, I'm assuming they aren't connected. 


5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
  Coolest thing I learned this week was how to use __dirname in Express. I know how difficult it can be to ensure that you get the correct path for everything to be routed correctly. Having this directory functionality built into exrpess is a really powerful variable that will do a lot in ensuring that links are nevere broken. 

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
  I personally didn't like how short/small the assignment was. I would have preferred to build ON to the shop/admin page with adding a user registration or root index, etc. Making several small projects seems tedious and unnecessarily redundant. 

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
