4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
  I'm not sure if nodemon is working, or installed at the correct scope. 

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
  My favorite piece of this assigment was learning that I could have the server create a new file and store the user input data into that file! 

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
  I would have loved for this assignment to be on a live-published page. I know that comes with limitations, because of the dynamic-ness of the server portion. But it's always more impactful when it can be run on a live site.
