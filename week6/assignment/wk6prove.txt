5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
  Coolest thing I learned this week... it wasn't so much a "learn" as it was solidying of knowledge... MVC. I've worked with projects using MVC, and have been successful, but Node.js seems to have a few more steps involved. This weeek I was successful on my own going through each routing statement and check for the correct paths, requires, views, etc. 

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
  I would suggest spending time on peronalizing the site at this point. You definitely learn more when you are working inside the code and making it unique.
